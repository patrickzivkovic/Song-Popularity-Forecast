# NLP Song Popularity Prediction Using Song Lyrics

## Project Description
This projectâ€™s goal is to assess if it is possible to predict the popularity
of songs with information that is generally publicly available. The data was
extracted from a Kaggle-dataset that included the artist, the song name and
the corresponding lyrics. The original data set was enriched with metadata from
Spotify and, to get further predictors, Natural Language Processing-methods were used
to extract song polarity and readability-indices from the song lyrics.

### Methods Used
* Descriptive Statistics
* Data Visualization
* Web Scraping
* Querying big databases
* Predictive Modelling (Regression, Random Forests, Neural Networks)

### Technologies
* R, Python
* spotifyR (for querying Spotify DBs)
* RMarkdown/knitR
* ggplot2
* Pandas,Keras, Tensorflow

### Results

In this project 5 different models were trained and 10-fold cross validated: a
baseline model predicting the mean, a simple generalized linear model, a neural
network, a distributed random forest, a gradient boosting machine and a stacked
ensemble model. All resulting models improved the prediction accuracy compared
to the baseline model with a mean absolute error of 12.758 and showed prediction
accuracy between 11.301 and 8.721 on the cross validated data, with the best
performing model being the stacked ensemble model.
